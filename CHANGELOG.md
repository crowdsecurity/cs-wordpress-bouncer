## [1.0.3](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/releases/tag/v1.0.3) - 2021-06-24
[_Compare with previous release_](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3)

---

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/releases/tag/v1.0.2) - 2021-06-24
[_Compare with previous release_](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2)

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/releases/tag/v1.0.1) - 2021-06-24
[_Compare with previous release_](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)
### Changed
- Update the package metadata to indicate to the Wordpress Marketplace that this plugin has been successuly tested
with the latest Wordpress 5.7 release (PHP 7.3, 7.4, 8.0)
- Update E2E tests dependencies

### Fixed
- Fix a problem when running dev environment on linux hosts : the "enable_ipv6" docker compose attribute was no more
accepted since in docker compose v3.

---

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2021-06-24
[_Compare with previous release_](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-wordpress-bouncer/compare/v0.6.0...v1.0.0)
### Added

- Add Standalone mode: an option allowing the PHP engine to no longer have to load the WordPress core during the
  bouncing stage. To be able to apply this mode, the webmaster has to set the auto_prepend_file PHP flag to the
  script we provide.
- Add debug mode: user can enable the debug mode directly from the CrowdSec advanced settings panel. A more verbose log
  will be written when this flag is enabled.
- Add WordPress 5.7 support
- Add PHP 8.0 support

### Changed
- Store Plugin in a flat file. This is a step to prepare the standalone mode.
- Prevent proxies from caching the wall pages. When the WP is covered by a reverse proxy (like a CDN, Varnish, Nginx
  reverse proxy etc), the wall page (ban or catpcha) is no more cached.


### Fixed
- Fix incompatibilities with other plugin (session_start). When another plugin uses PHP sessions, using the two
  plugins together trigger a PHP notice (session_start already sent). This has been fixed.
